# Challenging Fake Image Detection using GAN Models (Problem - 1)
## Problem Statement
Detecting fake or manipulated images in today's digital age has become increasingly
challenging due to the advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These
AI-powered tools have made it easier than ever to create convincing fake images that can
deceive both human observers and traditional image analysis techniques. The problem at hand
is to develop a robust and effective fake image detection system that can differentiate between
genuine and manipulated images generated by GAN models.

## Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uditsharma72/real-vs-fake-faces) for the reference.
It is divided into two subfolders, fake and real representing the fake images and real images respectively.
